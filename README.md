LookAround
==========

AngularJS  Learning Playground ( with some more items like Twitter bootstrap, Google maps API, TDD using Karma runner ) 

![LookAround Demo](https://raw.github.com/shidhincr/LookAround/master/demo/home.png)

[ ![Codeship Status for shidhincr/LookAround](https://www.codeship.io/projects/4f41c830-e268-0131-5932-1e7d1ef3bae4/status)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/25301)

What we're going to do ?
=======================

It'll be a simple application using Google maps API to load the location service and find the nearest ATM,Bar,Hotels, Pubs ..etc. Google is already
providing these informations in their Goole+ page –– but as I said earlier, we'll be mimicking the same for our learning purpose.

Technologies/Frameworks used here :
======================

- Angular JS
- Google Maps API
- Twitter bootstrap
- TDD ( Karma runner )
- Yeoman ( Optional now )


**Update** : *I couldn't set up the tests using karma due to time constraints. That's the next item in my TODO list.*

I'm so happy if you do. Fork the project, make whatever changes you want to do and submit a pull request. 

For testing it locally, there's a `web-server.js` file included in the `scripts` folder. Open up the terminal and run the JS file ( You need to have **NodeJS** installed ).
