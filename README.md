LookAround
==========

AngularJS  Learning Playground ( with some more items like Twitter bootstrap, Google maps API, TDD using Karma runner ) 

![LookAround Demo](https://raw.github.com/shidhincr/LookAround/master/demo/home.png)

What we're going to do ?
=======================

It'll be a simple application using Google maps API to load the location service and find the nearest ATM,Bar,Hotels, Pubs ..etc. Google is already
providing these informations in their Goole+ page –– but as I said earlier, we'll be mimicking the same for our learning purpose.

Technologies/Frameworks used here :
======================

- Angular JS
- Google Maps API
- Twitter bootstrap
- TDD ( Karma runner )
- Yeoman ( Optional now )


**Update** : *I couldn't set up the tests using karma due to time constraints. That's the next item in my TODO list.*
